Python tutorial on making a text based dungeon crawler

This project will teach key programming concepts that are required to write any program. Using these building blocks, we show how they can be applied in a way that it fun and does not limit the creativity of the learner. Hence why we have made a project where the learner gets to choose the genre and make thematic decisions throughout the development. With this in mind, we decided to make a text based game written using Python with the idea of role playing elements and strategic combat. This project has been split into 8 chapters where the first 3 cover the fundamentals and the rest concentrated on the actual game. Each chapter has some form of exercises or extension content to make sure that the learners understanding is reinforced and to push them to improve their skills.
